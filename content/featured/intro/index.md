## ü§ñÔ∏è Who Am I?
---

Hi, there! My name is Shiyi Shen. I'm currently a second-year graduate student at Brandeis University, specializing in Computational Linguistics. Before Brandeis, I finished my undergraduate degree majoring in Linguistics, Anthropology, and Japanese Studies. 

I have always had a passion for studying all aspects of languages, including but not limited to the pragmatics of Japanese, the language variation of American English, and the language and media of South East Asia. I was able to gain an extensive understanding of **how languages could reflect on other aspects of our social lives and human interactions (occupation, finance, social status, politics, and many more).** Upon finishing my degree, having decided that I should fully explore the practicality of Linguistics, I took a class that introduced me to Natural Language Processing. Had I taken the course earlier, I would choose to shift my focus of study a little bit early and enter the quantitative side of language studies without any doubt, because it is just...FASCINATING.

## üîß "Useless" or "Use unless"?

---

Generative? Discriminative? Rationalism? Empiricism? As the great philosopher/linguist Ludwig Wittgenstein has once suggested, **"the limits of my language mean the limits of my world."** Have you had the moment where words have absolutely failed your will to express the feelings that you desire to convey? And people would often laugh at you, should you disclose that you have got the opportunity to receive a good education but end up studying something "useless", assuming that language/liberal arts were one of them. Unless you were doing something "interesting" like becoming a speech pathologist or that you do signs. 

In all honesty, I would partially agree that this mentality had once become a potential threat and has since then been giving me anxiety and sleepless nights with toss and turns, just thinking about what I could do with my degree.  Moving forward in the field, I've, however, learned how **language is such an undeniably important medium to understanding the world around us and how it's, to some extent, a partial and distorted view to see language studies purely as a realm of liberal arts.**

## üî¨ Language == Science?

---

**Language is built on propositions**, as many would agree. If we don't approach something that grapples with reality, one would ask for the significance of studying natural languages. As ubiquitous as it could be and easily ignored a fact, language is one of the closest devices, if not the most effective, that humans could rely on for communication and information transmission.  

We are in an era of information explosion (newspapers, books, journals, and virtually everything on the internet) and full of symbols and representations. One may say the closest we could get to the discernment of our brain and mind, the acquisition of knowledge, and a deeper understanding of our world could be through understanding language. **It could also arguably imply that extracting inferences from the raw textual data through minimizing loss in the probabilistic truth is, therefore, a path closer and closer to the actual reality.** In the end, one hardly doesn't get amazed at how sentiments on Twitter could be in rhythm with the stock market and reflect instant market value. Robots could have a human-like conversation and learn how we converse.

## üå∞ In A Nutshell

---

Language is not a perfect model of reality, and we have other senses and media that are equally powerful modelings of the truth and world we scratch our head off trying to understand. Yet, **we can still master a language/paradigm perfect enough for gaining a better insight into human consciousness and obtain a deeper understanding of human reality.** All in all, I want to invite you with all my sincerity to embark on a journey with me. We together could explore how our wisdom gets manifested in the light of understanding natural languages through the lens of artificial intelligence. It is, I'd say, an experience that is UNIQUE to all of us. ‚ú®
