## Who Am I?
Hi, there! My name is Shiyi Shen. I'm currently a second year graduate student at Brandeis University specializing in Computational Linguistics. Prior to Brandeis, I finished my undergraduate degree majoring in Linguistics, Anthropology, and Japanese Studies. 

I have always had a passion for studying languages. I did my undergrad thesis in studying pragmatics of Japanese and had extensive understanding of how languages could reflect other aspects of our social lives and human interactions (occupation, finance, social status, politics, and many more). Toward the end of my undergraduate year upon finishing my degree, having decided that I should fully explore the practicality of linguistics, I took a class that introduced me into natural language processing. Had I taken the class earlier, I would choose to shift my focus of study a little bit early and enter the quantitative side of language studies without any second guessing, because language is just...FASCINATING. 

## "Useless" or "Use unless"?
Generative? Descriminative? Rationalism? Empiricism? As philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has suggested that, "the limits of my language means the limits of my world". Have you had the moment where words absolutely fail your will to express the feelings that you desire to convey? And people would often laugh at you, should you disclose that you've the opportunity to receive a good education but end up studying something "useless", assuming that language/libral arts were one of them. Unless you were doing something "interesting" like becoming a speech pathologist or you do signs. 

In all honesty, I would agree partially this mentality had once become a potential threat and has since then been giving me anxiety and sleepless nights with toss and turns, just thinking about what I could do with my degree. Moving forward in the field however, I've learned how language is such a important medium to understanding the world around us. 

## The Power of Language

**Language is built on propositions**, as many would agree. If we don't approach something that grapples with reality, one would ask for the significance of studying natural languages. We are surrounded by such an abundant pool of information provided in a written format (newspapers, books, journals, and virtually everything on the internet) - full of symbols and representations. As ubiquitous as it can be and easily ignored a fact that, language is one of the closest media, if not the most effective, that humans could rely on for communication and tranmitting information. The closest we could get to the discernment of our brain and mind, the acquisition of knowledge, and a deeper understanding of our world could, therefore, be through understanding language. 

One could also arguably suggest that extracting useful information from the ample raw textual data through minimizing loss in the probabilistic truth is therefore a path closer and closer to the actual truth - how fascinating this is. By the end of the day, we just get amazed at how sentiments on Twitter could be in rhythme with stock market and reflect instant market value; how robots can formulate a human-like conversation with humans through learning the way we talk; and how Information is power and the source of knowledge could come from langauge data. 

## In A Nutshell

Language is not a perfect a model of the reality, and we have other senses and media that are equally important modelings of the truth and world we scratch our head off trying to understand. Yet, we can still master a language/paradigm perfect enough that we can gain a better insight to human conciousness and obtain a deeper understanding of the human reality. All in all, I would invite you with all my sincerity to join me in this journey of a full imaginative and fun world where our wisdom is manifested in the light of understanding natural languages through the lens of artificial intelligence - an experience that is unique to all of us. ✨
