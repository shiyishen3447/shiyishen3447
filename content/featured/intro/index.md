**Welcome to my little niche where I have fun with NLP（Natural Language Processing）**

## Who Am I?
Hi, there! My name is Shiyi Shen. I'm currently a second year graduate student at Brandeis University specializing in Computational Linguistics. Prior to Brandeis, I finished my undergraduate degree majoring in Linguistics, Anthropology, and Japanese Studies. 

## The Power of Language 
I have always had a passion for studying languages. I did my undergrad thesis in studying pragmatics of Japanese and had extensive experience with how languages reflect other aspects of our social lives and human interactions (finances, occupation, social status, politics, and many more). 

A little backstory of how I got into the field of Natural Language Processing: TL;DR
I, toward the end of my undergraduate year upon finishing my degree, had decided that I should fully explore the practicality of lignuistics, therefore, took a class called Intro to Computational Linguistics. Had I taken the class earlier, I would choose to shift my focus of study a little bit early and enter the quantitative side of language studies without any second guessing. 

In the class, I learned how language is such a important medium to understanding the world around us, given the fact that we are surrounded by such an abundant pool of information provided in a written format (newspapers, books, journals, and virtually everything on the internet); how sentiments on Twitter could be in rhythme with stock market and reflect instant market value; and how Information is power and the source of knowledge could come from data. 

## "Useless" or "Use Unless"

People would often laugh at you, should you disclose that you've entered a prestigious school but end up studying something "useless". I assume that language/libral arts were one of them, unless you were doing something interesting like becoming a speech pathologist or you do signs. In all honesty, I would agree partially this mentality had become a potential threat and has given me anxiety and sleepless nights with toss and turns, just thinking about what I could do with my degree.
