## ü§ñÔ∏è Who Am I?
---

Hi, there! My name is Shiyi Shen. I'm currently a second-year graduate student at Brandeis University, specializing in Computational Linguistics. Before Brandeis, I finished my undergraduate degree majoring in Linguistics, Anthropology, and Japanese Studies. 

I have always had a passion for studying all aspects of languages, including but not limited to the pragmatics of Japanese, the language variation of American English, and the language and media of South East Asia. I was able to gain an extensive understanding of **how languages could reflect on other aspects of our social lives and human interactions (occupation, finance, social status, politics, and many more).** Upon finishing my degree, having decided that I should fully explore the practicality of Linguistics, I took a class that introduced me to Natural Language Processing. Had I taken the course earlier, I would choose to shift my focus of study a little bit early and enter the quantitative side of language studies without any doubt, because it is just...FASCINATING.

## üîß "Useless"?

---

Generative? Discriminative? Rationalism? Empiricism? As the great philosopher/linguist Ludwig Wittgenstein has once suggested, **"the limits of my language mean the limits of my world."** Have you had the moment where words have absolutely failed your will to express the feelings that you desire to convey? And people would often laugh at you, should you disclose that you have got the opportunity to receive a good education but end up studying something "useless", assuming that language/liberal arts were one of them. Unless you were doing something "interesting" like becoming a speech pathologist or that you do signs. 

In all honesty, I would partially agree that this mentality had once become a potential threat and has since then been giving me anxiety and sleepless nights with toss and turns, just thinking about what I could do with my degree.  Moving forward in the field, I've, however, learned how **language is such an undeniably important medium to understanding the world around us and how it's, to some extent, a partial and distorted view to see language studies purely as a realm of liberal arts.**

## üî¨ Language Studies Is Science

---

**Language is built on propositions**, as many would agree. If we don't approach something that grapples with reality, one would ask for the significance of studying natural languages. As ubiquitous as it could be and easily ignored a fact, language is one of the closest devices, if not the most effective, that humans could rely on for communication and information transmission. Could we, therefore, say that the closest we could get to the discernment of our brain and mind, the acquisition of knowledge, and a deeper understanding of our world, could be through understanding these abstractions and symbols? **Could it also arguably imply that extracting inferences from the raw textual data through minimizing loss in the probabilistic truth is, therefore, a path closer and closer to the actual reality? It is the** simple answer I could provide for a question like, ["what exactly is Natural Language Processing?"](https://nlpwshiyi.me/post/what-is-nlp/)

In light of Claude Shannon's taken on Information Theory in *The Mathematical Theory of Communication* in the late 50s and early 60s, a hypothesis,  established as the foundation later to the earliest development and researches into building Natural Language Understanding systems, draws inferences from *entropy* theory in the studies of thermodynamics. In this theory, word information is only viable if the sender and receiver are on par with each other. The signal, if in which exists a more chaotic "noisy channel" with unintelligible information to the receiver, might contain a surprisingly higher concentration of information content, which, having become the impoartant foundation for researches in acoustic and sound recognition systems, has also laid groundword for early heuristics in artificial intelligence.

There were certainly limitations and problems with Shannon et al's information theory as mentioned in an article, as it has rather a limited scope of application with regard to a broarder understanding of communication. Later, the discussions forwarded into the distinguishment between useful and useless information, semantic values and noises with high information content (potentially two different types of noises), and such, The probabilistic importance of measuring effectiveness in communication and word information has then also arised revolving around applying mathematical and statistical methods in pattern matching and keyword search and the advancement of the former into simple logical reasoning and question-answering. 

Now, we are in an era of information explosion (newspapers, books, journals, and virtually everything on the internet) and dealing with everything in such a symbolic manner. **Yet, we have seen words, phrases, and sentences being treated merely as *cold* numbers and vectors in these statistical spectra.** It seems to also be the fact that Natural Language Processing has, nowadays, nothing to do with language studies no more. It is all stochastic and probabilistic. Many have understood the fuzzy word NLP, AI, Machine Learning, and State-of-the-art technology through the field of "real" sciences. It came to the point that Lingusitics rarely had any say in this. Layman and even some linguists would now question the bridging connections between these hypotheses and aritficial intelligence. I will not in any case deny the beauty and importance of these natural science subjects. It just couldn't in any way stear me away from wanting to scream internally that "THERE IS A GREAT DEAL!".  

It's not hard to understand that language processing requires an extensive amount of parsing, and structural ambiguity has become the recurring theme and the unbeaten monster in question. Different styles of parsing were established in the course of research and development. **I could almost see myself cringing to have called myself a Linguist, if I held no understanding of Norm Chomsky's - a name ought to be mentioned here - transformation grammar, CFG, and the theory of generative syntax.** The importantce of his contributions to language studies and Natural Language Processing is beyond words. His formal language theory, particularly constituency grammar, is the knees bees. Combined with dynamic programming, the poweful computing framework, or a cherry on top, the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm has opened up a new world for researchers and scholars in exploring the elegance and marvel of context-free grammar.

## üå∞ In A Nutshell

---

In concluding remarks, language is not a perfect model of reality, and we have other senses and media that are equally powerful modelings of the truth and world we scratch our head off trying to understand. Yet, **we can still master a language/paradigm perfect enough for gaining a better insight into human consciousness and obtaining a deeper understanding of human reality.** In the end, one doesn't hardly get amazed at how sentiments on Twitter could be in rhythm with the stock and reflect instant market value. Robots could have a human-like conversation and learn how we converse. 



Thank you for bearing with me for a long detour, if you have reached all the way to here listening to me mumbling about my scattering thoughts and about my passion. All in all, I want to invite you with all my sincerity to embark on a journey with me. We together could explore how our wisdom gets manifested in the light of understanding natural languages through the lens of artificial intelligence. It is, I'd say, an experience that is UNIQUE to all of us. ‚ú®
