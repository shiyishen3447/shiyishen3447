## ü§ñÔ∏è Who Am I?
---

Hi, there! My name is Shiyi Shen. I'm currently a second-year graduate student at Brandeis University, specializing in Computational Linguistics. Before Brandeis, I finished my undergraduate degree majoring in Linguistics, Anthropology, and Japanese Studies. 

I have always had a passion for studying all aspects of languages, including but not limited to the pragmatics of Japanese, the language variation of American English, and the language and media of South East Asia. I was able to gain an extensive understanding of how languages could reflect on other aspects of our social lives and human interactions. Upon finishing my degree, having decided that I should fully explore the practicality of Linguistics, I took a class that introduced me to Natural Language Processing. Had I taken the course earlier, I would choose to shift my focus of study a little bit early and enter the quantitative side of language studies without any doubt, because it is just...FASCINATING.

## üîß "Useless"?

---

Have you ever had to face the predicament that your beloved parents had to put through so much for you to receive a good education but you want to study something humanities, liberal arts or social sciences? Unless you were doing something "useful" like becoming a speech pathologist or that you are aiming for a healthcare degree with a Lingusitics major, given that there seems to be no restrictions on the major(s) you end up with before entering any medical/nursing school as long as the required cirriculums are completed. 

In all honesty, I would partially agree that the simply equating liberal arts as "useless" banality, now a mere bias to me, had once become a potential threat, which had given me anxiety and sleepless nights with toss and turns, just thinking about what I could do with my degree.  Moving forward in the field, I've, however, learned how language is such an undeniably important medium to understanding the world around us and how it's, to some extent, a partial and distorted view to see language studies purely as a realm of liberal arts.

## üî¨ Language Studies Is Science

---

As ancient philosophers have rationalized (Plato, Cicero, the Stoics, etc), speech is one of the many faculties that distinguish a human mind from the brute animality. Could we, therefore, say that the closest we could get to the discernment of our brain and mind, the acquisition of knowledge, and a deeper understanding of our world, could be through understanding these abstractions and symbols? **Could it also arguably imply that extracting inferences from the raw textual data through minimizing loss in the probabilistic truth is, therefore, a path closer and closer to the actual reality?** It is the simple answer I could provide for a question like, ["what exactly is Natural Language Processing? (in the perspective of a computer/data scientist)"](https://nlpwshiyi.me/post/what-is-nlp/)

In light of Claude Shannon's taken on Information Theory in *The Mathematical Theory of Communication* in the late 50s and early 60s, drawing inferences from *entropy* theory in the studies of thermodynamics, **the development and research of sound recognition systems and early heuristics in artificial intelligence prospered, tackling issues with communication in a more mathematical manner.**  Meanwhile, the probabilistic importance of measuring effectiveness in communication arised, revolving around applying mathematical and statistical methods in pattern matching and keyword search and the advancement of the former into reasoning and question-answering. 

There were certainly limitations and problems with Shannon et al's information theory, as one of the many reasons was that it had rather a limited scope of application with regard to a broarder understanding of communication. Later, they also left the older model of communication in favor of something more systematic and discrete that can better describe the activities of a highly complex system such as computers, the human body, and such. 

Now, artifical intelligence is almost everywhere, and we are faced with all kinds of symbolisms and abstractions. It seems to also be the fact that **Natural Language Processing has, nowadays, nothing to do with language studies no more.** **In lieu of it was words, phrases, and sentences being treated merely as *cold* numbers and vectors in the statistical spectra.** It became all stochastic and probabilistic. It seems to have come to the point where Lingusitics could rarely have any say in this. Layman and even some linguists would now question if there are matter of fact any bridging connections. I am not in any case denying the beauty and importance of these natural science subjects. It just couldn't, however, in any way either, stear me away from stressing that there is a GREAT DEAL! 

One, if not the most important, of the very first things in a Natural Language Processing pipline, as many would agree is data annotation. **A well-structured and annotated data in a supervised NLP task can sometimes lend tremendous effort to a more successful outcome, which requires a deep understanding in the subject matter and of the issues that come with it.** For instance, parsing or sequence-modeling is one of the recurring themes, and structural ambiguity is almost the unbeatable monster here. I remembered staying up all night and pulling all nighters trying to come up with the perfect syntax tree for the semantics-wise most bizarre sentence ever. I would also often wonder whether, without Chomsky's formal language theory, more specifically constituency grammar, whether the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm, a computing framework/dynamic programming technique, would be able to tackle the issues with elegance and see the marvel of a context-free grammar. 

Of course, his theories aren't all so perfect after all. There were equally some limitations and problemsm, and they have well-received many rounds of critical attacks and heat. **Chomsky saw himself as a scientist along the way of establishing his language thoery and elaborating on his arguments.** The fact that they almost completely rebuke the legitimacy of empiricsm, dewelling only on that a grammar has to be innate and not everything could be learned from experience, has raised up the tide of any opposing waves. at the end of the day, his contributions to the field is beyond words.

## üå∞ In A Nutshell

---

In concluding remarks, I wouldn't say that language is a perfect model of reality, as the great philosopher/linguist Ludwig Wittgenstein has once suggested, **‚Äúthe limits of my language mean the limits of my world."** And we might have other senses and media that are equally powerful modelings of the truth and world we scratch our head off trying to understand. Yet, I am still amazed at how one can master a language/paradigm perfect enough for gaining a better insight into human consciousness and obtaining a deeper understanding of human reality. In the end, one doesn't hardly get amazed at how sentiments on Twitter could be in rhythm with the stock and reflect instant market value. Robots could have a human-like conversation and learn how we converse. 

Thank you for bearing with me for a long detour, if you have reached all the way to here listening to me mumbling about my scattering thoughts and about my passion. All in all, I want to invite you with all my sincerity to embark on a journey with me. We together could explore how our wisdom gets manifested in the light of understanding natural languages through the lens of artificial intelligence. It is, I'd say, an experience that is UNIQUE to all of us. ‚ú®
