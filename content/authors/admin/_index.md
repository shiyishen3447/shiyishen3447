I'm currently a second-year graduate student at Brandies University specialized in Computational Linguistics. My interests include natural language processing, machine translation, machine learning, and general programmable matter. I did my undergrad in Linguistics with a focus in East Asian and South Asian Literature and Cultural Heritages. I'm now also part of the SASE-Brandeis Committee as a student body committee partaking in activities to raise awareness of Asian ethnic groups in the STEM field.
